@channel  standup in one minute


[9:03] 
Yesterday I set up the web server and started the boilerplate for our app. Today I will look at dynamoDB, hoping to talk to Thomas about this.


thomaslv [9:05 AM] 
Standup: yesterday I set up mongodb in the repo. However I did not see Josh's post about aws not supporting mongo until it was too late. Today I will look at dynamo.


joshuajcamacho [9:06 AM] 
Cool @thomaslv do have time in the evening to chat real quickity ? Maybe at 6:30-7?


ben [9:06 AM] 
Yesterday Nathan  and I got familiar with html and java script. Those seemed like an easier first steps. I'll start looking at node and express tutorials today


[9:06] 
We also started the requirements doc


divya1224 [9:06 AM] 
I checked few free APIs which has more than 1000 recipes.. We can probably use them. I put them out in the google drive. I'll keep looking for more. Also I will start exploring more on express and node tutorials


ben [9:08 AM] 
Nathan is having a bit of trouble with Slack right now. I'll try to help him out


[9:09] 
The standup channel is not showing up for him


joshuajcamacho [9:09 AM] 
He has to join it


nathan [9:09 AM] 
joined #standup


nathan [9:09 AM] 
ok, got it


[9:10] 
i need the potential resources as well.


joshuajcamacho [9:10 AM] 
#potential_resources


thomaslv [9:11 AM] 
@joshuajcamacho I can meet at 6:30-7.


joshuajcamacho [9:11 AM] 
Cool


nathan [9:12 AM] 
Ben and I can meet then too.


[9:14] 
Did the teacher say he was going to post the weekly assignments on blackboard? Nothing's up yet



nathan [9:16 AM] 
I hope those assignments just require Java and not all this web stuff.


[9:18] 
btw my status is the same as Ben's.


ben [9:18 AM] 
We will see. I'm a little concerned about my ability to contribute to the projects. Got to do more tutorials.


joshuajcamacho [9:20 AM] 
It will get easier, especially after I make some pages that you can use as examples


ben [9:21 AM] 
Examples will be excellent. Thanks for the reassurance.


[9:25] 
so is the standup done now?


joshuajcamacho [9:27 AM] 
Yep all done. Thanks everyone

Ok @channel standup time


[10:02] 
Yesterday I setup aws for Thomas so he could start with the database. I also began planning for the design document. Today I will look over the requirements document for Ben and Nathan and will start the design document


nathan [10:03 AM] 
Yesterday, I started looking at a tutorial for Materialize CSS. I wan't able to get much else done because I had another class. Today, I will continue the CSS Tutorial and the requirements document.


ben [10:04 AM] 
Yesterday I downloaded some tools so I can start learning node.js. I ran into some problems. Not sure if they are all solved yet. Today I plan on continuing tutorials and working on the requirements document with Josh's advice.


divya1224 [10:05 AM] 
Yesterday: Worked on fetching more recipes. Found few more APIs . Could not find any API that directly matches our requirement. We might have to further filter them in our application after fetching it .Today : I'll continue to look for more APIs. Also exploring options to download readily available downloadable data


thomaslv [10:07 AM] 
Yesterday I discussed some database/aws compatibility/ease-of-use options with Josh, we ultimately decided on dynamoDB, so I looked into some tutorials and set up a recipe table. Today I'll explore more dynamoDB documentation.


divya1224 [10:10 AM] 
Also, when I was exploring I found that Heroku Database has more options than


[10:10] 
Dynamo DB


thomaslv [10:10 AM] 
@divya1224 make sure to put the APIs you find into the potential-resources file. As of right now the data requirements we need are just ingredients, recipe name, recipe and the style of food(ie: Chinese, Italian, etc.) preferably in JSON format as thatd be the most easy to populate the database. Once we discuss a few more requirements with Rodriguez at the next meeting we can begin populating the database. The problem with prepopulating a database is if we decide we need anything more than what the model allows, it can be tricky to add.


ben [10:11 AM] 
Josh, can you upload the notes you took on Tuesday when we meet with the professor?


divya1224 [10:11 AM] 
sure @thomaslv


thomaslv [10:11 AM] 
Ill look into Heroku, but we're using dynamo because it's amazons and we'll be hosting the page with amazon, so it all kinda slides together nicely.


[10:12] 
*we chose dynamo* Im not opposed to using Heroku if it is better for us


divya1224 [10:12 AM] 
even heroku is through amazon.. it has many free options..


thomaslv [10:12 AM] 
that wasnt supposed to bold, that was supposed to be a correction haha


joshuajcamacho [10:12 AM] 
@ben yes


divya1224 [10:13 AM] 
sure.. just in case if you encounter any issues with Dynamo


joshuajcamacho [10:13 AM] 
@divya1224 @thomaslv it would be ideal if we also had pictures of the recipes. This is super important for the design of the app


thomaslv [10:13 AM] 
Oh yeah, makes sense.


divya1224 [10:15 AM] 
the main challenge im facing is .. i cant find any API that returns only recipes with the just the ingredients that we request .. it also includes other ingredients apart from the ones we request for..


[10:16] 
my question .. can we further filter the additional ingredients in our application


ben [10:17 AM] 
How are the recipes formated? JSON? Text?


divya1224 [10:18 AM] 
most of them are JSON


joshuajcamacho [10:19 AM] 
@ben @nathan the notes are on the google drive. If you have any questions about them (they're a little sloppy) just shoot me a message


ben [10:20 AM] 
@joshuajcamacho cool, thanks


thomaslv [10:20 AM] 
This definitely wouldnt scale, so its not good practice but... I was thinking the way we would do it was prepopulate our database with 1000 recipes. Then we search our own database for recipes that only contain the ingredients we have. Eventually if it mattered we could hash ingredients to recipes but for now I think we can just linear search for now. Although josh could probably provide more insight.


joshuajcamacho [10:21 AM] 
exactly thomaslv


[10:22] 
@divya1224 we just need the raw data. Recipes (which includes the steps to make the recipes) + ingredients + photos of said recipes


[10:22] 
There might be an API out there that suits our needs, or we might have to web scrape if push comes to shove


divya1224 [10:23 AM] 
sure.. sounds good.. i'll explore options on raw data


joshuajcamacho [10:24 AM] 
ty @channel standup is now over but feel free to keep the conversations flowing between eachother (edited)


divya1224 [10:26 AM] 
just a thought .. do we need to discuss on finalizing the requirements before we freeze it and move over to design phase?


joshuajcamacho [10:27 AM] 
some things can be done in parallel. There will always be a "landing page" for example. But yeah typically you finalize the requirements before starting the design


[10:28] 
Thats part of why I'm going over the requirements document today


[10:28] 
maybe tomorrow we can all look over the requirements document and sign off on it


divya1224 [10:29 AM] 
sure.. Thanks @joshuajcamacho


joshuajcamacho [10:29 AM] 
thank you @divya1224 good that you brought that up

Yesterday, I worked on the requirements doc with Nathan and started learning Node.js. Today I plan on reviewing the requirements doc with the team and continuing the tutorials.


joshuajcamacho [9:08 AM] 
Yesterday I read through the requirements document and added a tiny bit. He did say 3-5 pages right ? We're sitting at 3.1 pages so it might be solid enough. Today I will make sure everyone signs off on the requirements document and make progress on the design document


thomaslv [9:08 AM] 
Standup: yesterday i checked out some more dynamodb docs along with heroku. Although Im not sure if I was looking at the wrong thing but Heroku is a service similar to aws. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9802259/why-do-people-use-heroku-when-aws-is-present-what-distinguishes-heroku-from-aws
stackoverflow.com
Why do people use Heroku when AWS is present? What distinguishes Heroku from AWS?
I'm a beginner RoR programmer who's planning to deploy my app using Heroku. Word from my other advisor friends says that Heroku is really easy, good to use. The only problem is that I still have no...
 


nathan [9:09 AM] 
Yesterday, I worked on the requirements doc with Ben and did more tutorials on Materialize CSS. Today I plan to finalize the requirements doc and start learing Node js.


divya1224 [9:09 AM] 
Yesterday : I started training on express and nodes . Also, yummly looks like a good API. Its a paid API


[9:09] 
I got a free version of it for 1 month


joshuajcamacho [9:10 AM] 
Nice @divya1224 I'll check it out today


divya1224 [9:11 AM] 
@thomaslv Even in my research, I saw that they are many free services that can be used with Heroku..It looks like a good for academic projects..


thomaslv [9:11 AM] 
Today I plan on reviewing the requirements doc and doing a little bit of research on what might be needed to implement the finalized requirements.


divya1224 [9:12 AM] 
Today : I'll revisit the APIs or database approach after our requirement session


ben [9:13 AM] 
Can everyone review the requirements doc after the standup?


divya1224 [9:13 AM] 
sure.. Is it ready for review?


ben [9:14 AM] 
yes


divya1224 [9:15 AM] 
cool.. I can check it after the standup

Ok. Everyone. If you're sure about something, go ahead and change it. Otherwise leave a comment or post on Slack. Try to think of things to make it a little longer


thomaslv [9:33 AM] 
The requirements doc looks good to me.


divya1224 [9:58 AM] 
The requirement looks good to me too.. Good work Ben and Nathan .. I want to make slight changes ( more cosmetic types) . I'll add my changes in different font so that it can be tracked easily

During the weekend i completed the register modal and started working on the project timeline .

nathan [9:11 AM] 
So, the teacher wants a prototype, data model, and architectural model on Tuesday. I believe I made a good data model on the project report, but I'm not sure I know enough about how the project works to make an architectural model.


[9:12] 
From what I understand now, there's just the server, the interface, and the database. That seems a little too simple. Any ideas for adding more?

thomaslv [9:14 AM] 
Over the weekend I set up the recipe and ingredient tables. Today Id like to finally finish the database population, Ill also touch base with Josh later to see if there is anything he needs a hand on. Nathan I can check it out in the afternoon and help out where i can.

@joshuajcamacho Are we good on prototype or do you need any help ?

ben [9:19 AM] 
Does the prototype need a way to add recipes, or just search them?

thomaslv [9:19 AM] 
The prototype only needs to allow recipes to be posted and display the recipes posted by rhe user

divya1224 [9:22 AM] 
yeah.. I agree

How do you guys think we should handle ingredient sub-types? If I search for eggs, I might not want to choose between 12 different types


[9:06] 
But it seems like a lot of work to group them up with tags and sub menus and stuff


[9:09] 
Maybe we can just keep all the ingredients separate and not get excessive with adding multiple types of the same type of ingredient.

Ok. I won't be home until 5:30


[9:07] 
Also, do we need to worry about using up our free calls to the data base. I'm loading 100 recipes every time I test the site.

joshuajcamacho [9:08 AM] 
I don't think so, plus 100 recipes are pulled in a single call

ben [9:09 AM] 
Ok, good to know.

nathan [9:10 AM] 
How will we add the pictures of the ingredients to the database? Does Side Chef has pictures of the individual ingredients?

ben [9:11 AM] 
Today, I will keep working on the ingredient view

thomaslv [9:11 AM] 
No, Im scraping ingredient information from wikipedia.


[9:12] 
So the images + descriptions will come from there.

@joshuajcamacho  Can you merge the changes and let me know if you need any changes.. I tried few other 'fancy' Menus but they did not fit into our page

Yesterday, I finished the skeleton of the project report and presentation. Today, I will work on filling those out.

Yesterday I worked on the ingredient population script, today I hope to finish that and populate 50 recipes of each "type" that sidechef allows queries by. (Mexican, italian, etc)

ben [12:01 PM] 
Yesterday, I worked on the ingredient view. Today, I will keep working on that and update the standup logs.
